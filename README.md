# Simon Vo Engineer Portfolio

  Welcome! I am a student at the University of Southern California studying Aerospace Engineering. Currently I am a aerodynamic member on the USC FSAE team. This is my portfolio.

## Projects

### Wake Deflector (USC FSAE IC)
- **Role:** design + firmware
- **Software:** Siemens NX, Star-CCM+
- **Goals:** Increase downforce and lower yaw sensitivy by creating a aerodynamic component position on the front suspention geometry
- **Skills Learn:** Design for Manufractuing, Aerodynamics Validation using Pitots Tubes, Rapid Iteration, Aerodynamic design & CFD analysis  
- **Result:** Increase downforce in Yaw by 60N, and lower yaw sensitivity by 7%.

### Open Steel Frame (USC FSAE IC)
- **Role:** design + simulation
- **Goals:** To create a structural simulation model that will characterize the stiffness of the frame to perform rapid iteration in order to save weight while maitaining desire stifness.
- **Skills Learn:** Structural FEA, Design for Manufractuing, Tube-frame modeling, Simulation correlation & validation against physical measurements, 
- **Result:** Simulated & validated 4130 steel tube chassis (66 lb); reached 2700 Nm/deg frame stiffness @ wheel with 2% simulation error.


### Orbes Sensor Fusion and Motor Control (Due to the fact that this was done at a company I am unable to disclose the codebase)
- **Stack:** Python, C++, ESP32, Raspberry pi 5, Adafruits 9DOF IMU, Infrared Cameras, PiCam
- **Result:** Implemented AprilTag yaw detection with 0.1° accuracy within 2 m for real‑time orientation control. Achieved 6 s settle time for 90° start–stop maneuvers.

### Aero Components Mounts (USC FSAE)
- **Role:** design + firmware + simulation
- **Goals:** Previous aero mount are over engineer, thus the mount need to be redesign to reduce weight in addtion to the increase in the aero package weight.
- **Skills Learn:** Design for Manufracturing, Structural FEA
- **Result:** Reduce Mass by 30% while experiecing 50% more load.
